# Job-Search
* A Job search app that allows a user to search for jobs based on their location.
* A User can log in through their Facebook account then they will see a map which is according to their current location.
* The user can drag the map in the region where user wants to search for jobs and set the location.
* Now Indeed API will fetch the jobs according to the location coordinates that the user has fixed.
* These Jobs will be shown to the user in the form of a stack of cards where the user can left swipe if he doesn't like the job, or can swipe right side if he likes the job.
* according to his likes all liked jobs were shown on different screens.
* in the liked jobs Screen each liked job is shown in the form of a card which has a button which has a feature to apply to that job.

## WARNING
* Indeed API has been depricated Therefore This Project Will no Longer Work Properly.

## Suggestion
* If there is an API available for jobs then I will update this project very soon.
* Please if anyone finds any JOB SEARCH API please message to my mail which is there in my profile.
